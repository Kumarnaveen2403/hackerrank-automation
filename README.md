# hackerrank-automation
A script to automate the process of adding moderators to a contest on hackerrank, as this process can be very tedious if you have a lot of mods.

To run this script, you need a json file named "creds.json" in this format :

{
    "username" : "YourUserName",
    "password" : "YourPassword",
    "moderators" : [
        "mod1",
        "mod2",
        "mod3"
    ]
}

Put your username and password and add any number of mods in the given format.
